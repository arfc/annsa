## annsa

Artificial neural networks for spectroscopic analysis (annsa) is a python 
package that can quickly generate prototype gamma-ray spectrum datasets and 
train artificial neural networks on those datasets.

### Install

To install, either git clone the annsa repo or download and unzip the zip file. In your command line run:

```
cd annsa
python setup.py install
```

#### Standard Naming Convention for Spectrum Files
Ex. 
"99MTc\_500.0\_50.0\_lead\_0.0\_2.0.spe"

This is for a spectrum taken with the following parameters<br/>
Technetium-99, metastable<br/>
500cm away from detector<br/>
50cm above ground<br/>
Lead shielding<br/>
'Areal' density of shielding<br/>
Full width half max of 2.0<br/>
File type: .spe<br/>
