#### Standard Naming Convention for Spectrum Files
Ex. 
"99MTc\_500.0\_50.0\_lead\_0.0\_2.0.spe"

This is for a spectrum taken with the following parameters:
Technetium-99, metastable\\
500cm away from detector\\
50cm above ground\\
Lead shielding\\
'Areal' density of shielding\\
Full width half max of 2.0\\
File type: .spe\\
