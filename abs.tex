There is a need to develop an algorithm that can identify and quantify isotopes in low-resolution gamma-ray spectra. Trained gamma-ray spectroscopists typically rely on intuition when identifying isotopes in spectra. Because they incorporate something similar to the intuition used by trained spectroscopists, pattern recognition algorithms such as neural networks are prime candidates for automated isotope identification. Algorithms based on feature extraction such as peak finding or ROI algorithms work well for well-calibrated high resolution detectors. For low-resolution detectors, it may be more beneficial to use algorithms that incorporate more abstract features of the spectrum. To investigate this, an artificial neural network (ANN) was trained to predict the presence and relative activities of isotopes from gamma-ray spectra. The ANN is trained with simulated gamma-ray spectra, allowing easy expansion of the library of target isotopes. This proposal outlines extensions to this work including investigating new datasets and ANN structures.
