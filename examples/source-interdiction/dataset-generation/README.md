### Dataset Generation
Using these notebooks, datasets can be constructed with a various simulation parameters. For the dissertation, both a wide range of parameters and a simplified range of parameters were used.

Note, due to the inclusion of shielding in the complete dataset, some source templates had zero spectral counts and were dropped when loading the templates.
